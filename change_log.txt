## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Ability to read in credential output from a previous run
- Ability to read XML formatted Cobalt Strike credential exports

## [2.0.0] - 2020-04-23
### Added
- A change log
- ASCII art (two different versions; based on terminal width)
- Version number to code
- Support for Python 3
- JSON config file to minimize the need to consistently provide command-line arguments or edit the code directly to change certain settings
- Logging to help with troubleshooting
- Three output verbosity levels (0 = Minimal, 1 = Normal, 2 = Info)
- Simple wordlist support to aid in password cracking
- Sample data from my lab network; useful for trying out the tool if you don't have your own data
- README with more than one line of info

### Changed
- Removed command-line options for individual file types and replaced with data type auto-detection based on filename. Files must be named properly; however, this vastly improves the flexibility of Parseltongue as it allows processing multiple files of the same type, including across NT domains.
- Modified console output (including spacing) to improve readability
- Modified the password cracker ingest output file to only include accounts that don't have a matching plaintext password

### Removed
- Support for Python 2
- Limitation to process data for a single NT domain at a time

### Fixed
- Added quotes around CSV output fields to avoid issues where plaintext password contain commas
